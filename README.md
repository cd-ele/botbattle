# Bot Battle
Bienvenido a la implementación de bots de catan para nuestro proyecto de la asignatura PROJECT III :)

We are working on three different bots.

1. Miguel Ángel:
   
This strategy focuses on city-building, as cities provide double the resources as settlements. Try to obtain wheat and ore primarily to maximize the number of cities and continually increase the amount of resources generated.

2. Mary
   
This is the weakest and most set-up dependent strategy but can lead to glorious victory on the right board. Basically, you throw all thoughts of balance out the window and gamble on a single resource for which you also have the matching port. It's done with sheep, because the other resources are valued more highly and you won't be able to sweep them all up in the same way. Also, who's going to rob you when they know they'll just get a sheep?

Good ONLY when ALL the following are true:
- the board is sheep rich
- the sheep are clustered together and can be monopolized
- you have the sheep port
- everyone else is going for another strategy
- the board is ore-poor and/or badly imbalanced between ore/wheat and wood/brick (this will slow down everyone else enough to give you time to win)

Do:
- try to trade sheep all the time, if not able, trade away at 2:1 with your port.
- focus on bulding your first two cities. Don't get distracted by all that road and settlement building. You want more sheep so cities are a good idea.
- collect lots of development cards. Stay in the race to Largest Army
- secure the most amount of sheep plus at least some of the 4 remaining resources. If you have to trade for more than one or two resources you're probably going to lose.

3. Napoleon
   
This strategy focuses on sprawling across the board, building a long road and settlements along it. Players who like this strategy look for lots of wood and brick in their initial placements. A typical winning combination will involve 2 cities, 4 settlements and longest road. This strategy looks stronger than it is, because it typically lets you race to 7 points (5 settlements + longest road) but stalls catastrophically in the end game when you desperately need ore and everyone is pounding you with the robber and refusing to trade with you because you're in the points lead.

Good when the following are true:
- you can secure a strong supply of brick and wood
- you can see a way to get the ore you need for your cities late in the game
- you can get to a port to get late-game ore/wheat when wood/brick is less valuable
- everyone else is going for another strategy

Do:
- build settlements along your road. Nothing worse than having the longest road as the lynch pin of your strategy, only to have someone build a settlement in the middle of it!
- secure approximately twice as much wood and brick as wheat, and approximately twice as much wheat as sheep and ore.
